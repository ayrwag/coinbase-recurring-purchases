# Coinbase API Recurring Purchases
A crypto DCA server coded in kotlin & OkHttp3
## What is Dollar-Cost-Averaging (DCA)?
DCA is a way of minimizing risk by spreading your investments.

This server allows you to make small crypto orders on a daily schedule (24-hours apart) 

**Bonus:** *while saving a lot on swap fees.*
### API Saves over 97.9% on fees (August 2024)
**Normal Retail Fee**

Coinbase retail fees for recurring investments will range you anywhere from 50% (on the large end) to 14.2% (on the medium range) of your orders.

Making trades through the API reduces that to 0.6% instead.

# How *'Kotlin Coinbase Recurring Purchases'* works
It uses your quote asset balance i.e USD (which is free to top up via bank transfers).

And once USD (or quote asset) runs out it will switch quote asset to using USDC instead (coming soon).

### Uses CDP API
This application uses CDP API credentials (Coinbase Developer Platform) to make trades on your behalf. Credentials should be placed as a .json file  in the same directory as the .jar file.

Alternatively, Environment variables (.env) can be used. COINBASE_NAME & COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
